# Website-Code
I've added a few programs to my website, as a sample for what my portfolio could work like. I've also looked into how to make questionnaires with html, and I've added one about teachers in my website. I thought including multiple websites and programs to my homepage was a good way to diversify the assignment, and learn more about organizing a homepage and coding it.
